Test Task (completed)
=========

! Notes !
-------------

I decided that technical requirements doc is more prevalent than project pom file, so Vaadin is switched from 7.6.7 to 8.0.0.

It caused some exceptions on startup, but then everything works good.

! Additional folders !
-------------

/local-db - contains local in-process db data

/sql - contains sql for creating tables and filling them with sample data
